# `ropty`

`ropty` the read-only  Pty website tool.

## Why?


## Security Considerations

Security Considerations
- **Sanitize Output:** Ensure the output streamed to the client does not contain any sensitive information or control sequences that could exploit the client's browser.
- **Read-Only:** The setup described is inherently read-only because it does not process any input from the client to the pty session. Still, ensure that this is strictly enforced.
- **Process Isolation:** Run the terminal process with minimal privileges to reduce security risks. Consider using containers or virtual machines for additional isolation.

## Setup

git clone
